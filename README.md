# Decode Rot-N Cipher
Now the second job is to break the Rot-N cipher we talked about in the class.

Please proceed to the `rot-N` folder. You will find the following files after the `ls` command:
```
flag quotes.txt rot-N template.py
```

Please fix the `template.py` file. This file runs `rot-N` file, which reads one of the quotes from the `quotes.txt`, encrypts it by shifting the text by N, and returns the ciphertext. You are required to edit the TODO parts to reverse-engineer the plaintext from the ciphertext. Once you're successful, you will get the flag
